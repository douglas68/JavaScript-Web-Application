## What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?

## I used the same quote website because I already wanted to integrate an API database or AI to generate quotes. Looking back, I would have spent more time improving the CSS design since styling isnâ€™t my strongest skill. I should have used this project as an opportunity to practice CSS more intentionally.

## Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?

## This project was actually easier to implement than the last lab. None of the requirements were too difficult. With more practice and familiarity with APIs, future implementations should be even smoother.

## What would you add to, or change about your application if given more time?

## I would focus on making the design look prettier and explore integrating AI to generate unique quotes in addition to pulling from APIs.

## Use this space to make notes for your future self about anything that you think is important to remember about this process. 

## I added an API to this website, but in the future it would be great to expand functionality. For example, organizing quotes by categories to give users more control over what type of inspiration they see.
